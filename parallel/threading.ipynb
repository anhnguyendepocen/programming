    "\n",
    "In Python, threading allows us to run multiple I/O bound tasks concurrently, so if we have two tasks on our hand, task A and task B, we can run them simultaneously without having to wait for task A to finish before running running task B. The keyword here is \"I/O bound\". The **GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)** in Python that prevents threads from actually running in parallel. The GIL is necessary because the Python interpreter is not thread safe. This means that there is a globally enforced lock when trying to safely access Python objects from within threads. At any time only a single thread can acquire a lock for a Python object or C API. This is the reason that makes threads unsuitable for CPU intensive tasks in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, threads are very efficient and beneficial for task that are not CPU intensive. The benefit of threading in Python appears when our problems are network bound or data input/output (I/O) bound. This means that the Python interpreter is waiting for the result of a function call that's manipulating with data from an external source, such as network address or hard disk. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a Python code that is scraping many web URLs. By adding a new thread for each download resource, the code can download multiple data sources in parallel and combine the results at the end of every download. This means that each subsequent download is not waiting on the download of earlier web pages. In this case the program is now bound by the bandwidth limitations of the client/server(s) instead.\n",
