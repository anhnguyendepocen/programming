    "With the 5 threads that we've specified, we might expect less than 5X speedup (less than 5 because we expect there's always going to overhead associated with creating the threads and managing the coordination between them).

At any one time only a single thread can acquire a lock for a Python object or C API. This is the reason that makes threads unsuitable for CPU intensive tasks in Python.\n",

    "On the other hand, threads are very efficient and beneficial for task that are not CPU intensive. The benefit of threading in Python appears when our problems are network bound or data input/output (I/O) bound. This means that the Python interpreter is waiting for the result of a function call that's manipulating with data from an external source, such as network address or hard disk. \n",

By adding a new thread for each download resource, the code can download multiple data sources in parallel and combine the results at the end of every download.
