// 1. private makes the method accessible to the current class
// and other instances of the current class
// 2. protected makes the method available to the sub-class

// is the same as java. We use super to refer to the parent class
// and then provide the method name

// defining a method that returns multiple items
// in Java we might need to define a one-off class,
// but in Scala we can return tuples
def getStockInfo = {
    // some other code here
    ("NFLX", 100.00, 101.00)

// and we can assign variable names when calling the method
// this is probably the most readable way
val (symbol, currentPrice, bidPrice) = getStockInfo

// or we can set a single variable equal to the tuple returned
// by the method, and access it later with tuple underscore syntax
val result = getStockInfo

// in Scala, the convention is to define the accessor
// without parenthesis after the method name, as the
// accessor should have no side effect

    // and unlike Java, the convention in Scala is to leave off the get
    // so we do not need to write getCrustSize

// creating variable that takes variable argument,
// we can define this in our method by adding a * character

    // we typically use a loop to handle varargs argument
    strings.foreach(println)
}

// use _* to adapt to sequence, we can think
// of it as the splat operator, it tells the compiler
// to pass each element of the sequence as an argument,
// as oppose to passing the sequence as a single argument
