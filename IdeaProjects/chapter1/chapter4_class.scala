// (like final in Java) thus it only has getters

// when neither val or var is declared, then the visibility
// of the field becomes very restricted as neither getter or
// setter is defined. This has the exception of case class,
// where its constructor parameters are val by default.
// This is a nice convenience due to the fact that it's
// often used in functional programming as immutable records

// overriding getters and setters, or so called accessors and mutators
// in Scala:

// generating its accessor and mutator
// then the name_= conforms to the Scala convention (underneath the hood,
// Scala will translate the = to $eq to work with the JVM)

// 3. field are val by default, thus getters are generated for them
// 4. an unapply method is generated, making it easy to perform

// a regular class and implement the functionality ourselves
