    "## What is ensembling?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ensemble learning (or \"ensembling\")** is the process of combining several predictive models in order to produce a combined model that is more accurate than any individual model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regression:** take the average of the predictions\n",
    "- **Classification:** take a vote and use the most common prediction, or take the average of the predicted probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "For ensembling to work well, the models must have the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accurate:** they outperform the null model\n",
    "- **Independent:** their predictions are generated using different processes\n",
    "\n",
    "**The big idea:** If you have a collection of individually imperfect (and independent) models, the \"one-off\" mistakes made by each model are probably not going to be made by the rest of the models, and thus the mistakes will be discarded when averaging the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic **methods for ensembling:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Manually ensemble your individual models\n",
    "- Use a model that ensembles for you\n",
    "\n",
    "# Part 2: Manual ensembling\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes a good manual ensemble?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Different types of **models**\n",
    "- Different combinations of **features**\n",
    "- Different **tuning parameters**"
