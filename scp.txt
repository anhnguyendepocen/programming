You can do a fast, single-line transfer from the terminal using the scp ("secure copy") command, which works just like ssh:
 
$ scp -i my_key_file file_to_copy me@wolf.iems.northwestern.edu:.

# or if you've set up .ssh/config
$ scp file_to_copy wolf:.

# to copy a file from wolf to local:
$ scp wolf:results/output.csv .	 	

the . at the end is the current directory on your local machine 

The :. at the end is shorthand for the directory you land in when you ssh in, i.e. your home directory.
