    "At a high level `Word2Vec` is a unsupervised learning algorithm that uses a shallow neural network (with one hidden layer) to learn the vectorial representations of all the unique words/phrases for a given corpus. The advantage that word2vec offers is it tries to preserve the semantic meaning behind those terms. For example, a document may employ the words \"dog\" and \"canine\" to mean the same thing, but never use them together in a sentence. Ideally, the word2vec algorithm would be able to learn the context and place them together in similar vector semantic space.\n",

    "## Model Details\n",
    "\n",
    "The way the model works underneath the hood is that trains a neural network by do the following: Given a specific word in the middle of a sentence (the input word), look at the words nearby and pick one at random. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a **window size** hyperparameter to the algorithm that quantifies the word \"nearby\". A typical window size might be 5, meaning 5 words behind and 5 words ahead (10 in total). There're some implementations that something even fancier: Instead of using a fix $k$ window around each word, the window is uniformly distributed from $1, 2, ..., K$, where $K$ is the max window size we specify.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below shows some of the training samples (word pairs) we would take from the sentence \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\" We'll used a small window size of 2 just for the example. The word highlighted in blue is the input word.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/skipgram.png\" width=\"60%\" height=\"60%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "After feeding a bunch of word pairs to the network, it is going to tell us the probability for every word in our vocabulary being \"nearby\" word that we chose. The output probabilities are going to relate to how likely it is find each vocabulary word nearby our input word. For example, if we gave the trained network the input word \"Soviet\", the output probabilities should be much higher for words like \"Union\" and \"Russia\" than for unrelated words like \"watermelon\" and \"kangaroo\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So how is this all represented? First of all, we know we can't feed a word just as a text string to a neural network (or probably any machine learning model), i.e. we need a way to represent the words to the network. To do this, we first build a vocabulary of words from our training documents. We'll assume that our corpus has a vocabulary size of 10,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re going to represent an input word like \"ants\" as a one-hot vector. This vector will have 10,000 components (one for every unqiue word in our vocabulary) and we'll place a \"1\" in the position corresponding to the word \"ants\", and 0s in all of the other positions. The output of the network is a single vector (also with 10,000 components) containing, for every word in our vocabulary, the probability that a randomly selected nearby word is that vocabulary word. Here’s the architecture of our single-layer neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/word2vec_architecture.png\" width=\"70%\" height=\"70%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no activation function on the hidden layer neurons, but the output neurons use softmax. We’ll come back to this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "When training this network on word pairs, the input is a one-hot vector representing the input word and the training output is also a one-hot vector representing the output word. But when we evaluate the trained network on an input word, the output vector will actually be a probability distribution (i.e., a bunch of floating point values, not a one-hot vector).\n",

    "## The Hidden Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that we wish to learn word vectors with 300 features. The number of features is a hyperparameter that we would have to tune to our application to see which one yields the best result. So the hidden layer is going to be represented by a weight matrix with 10,000 rows (one for every word in our vocabulary) and 300 columns (one for every hidden neuron).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if we look at what would happen when we multiply the 1 x 10,000 one-hot vector representation of the word with a 10,000 x 300 matrix that represents the hidden layer's weight, it will effectively just select the matrix row corresponding to the \"1\". The following figure is a small example that does a matrix multiplication of a 1 x 5 one hot vector with a 5 x 2 hidden layer's weight to give you a visual. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/hidden_layer.png\" width=\"70%\" height=\"70%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the hidden layer of this model is really just operating as a lookup table. The output of the hidden layer is just the \"word vector\" for the input word.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Output Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "The 1 x 300 word vector for \"ants\" then gets fed to the output layer. The output layer is a softmax regression classifier. There's another documentation on Softmax Regression [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ethen8181/machine-learning/blob/master/deep_learning/softmax.ipynb), but the gist of it is that each output neuron, one per word in our vocabulary will produce an output probability between 0 and 1 and the sum of all these output values will add up to 1.\n",

And one way for the network to output similar context predictions for these two words is if the word vectors are similar. So to hit the notion home, if two words have similar contexts, then word2vec is motivated to learn similar word vectors for these two words!"

    "You may have noticed that the skip-gram neural network contains a huge number of weights ... For our example with 300 features and a vocab of 10,000 words, that's 3M weights in the hidden layer and output layer each! Training this on a large dataset would be slow and prone to overfitting, so the word2vec authors introduced a number of tweaks to make training feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modifying the optimization objective with a technique they called \"Negative Sampling\", which causes each training sample to update only a small percentage of the model’s weights\n",

    "\n",
    "Training a neural network means taking a training example and adjusting all of the neuron weights slightly so that it predicts that training sample more accurately. In other words, each training sample will tweak all of the weights in the neural network. As we discussed above, the size of our word vocabulary means that our skip-gram neural network has a tremendous number of weights, all of which would be updated slightly by every one of our billions of training samples! Negative sampling addresses this by having each training sample only modify a small percentage of the weights, rather than all of them. Here’s how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "When training the network on the word pair (\"fox\", \"quick\"), we want the \"correct output\" of the network, that is the output neuron corresponding to \"quick\" to output a 1, and for all of the other thousands of output neurons to output a 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "With negative sampling, we are instead going to randomly select just a small number of \"negative\" words (let’s say 5) to update the weights for. (In this context, a \"negative\" word is one for which we want the network to output a 0 for). We will also still update the weights for our “positive” word (which is the word “quick” in our current example).\n",
    "\n",
    "> The paper says that selecting 5-20 words works well for smaller datasets, and we can get away with only 2-5 words for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the output layer of our model has a weight matrix that's 300 x 10,000. So we will just be updating the weights for our positive word (\"quick\"), plus the weights for 5 other words that we want to output 0. That’s a total of 6 output neurons, and 1,800 weight values total. That’s only 0.06% of the 3M weights in the output layer!\n",

    "\n",
    "One little detail that's missing from the description above is how do we select the negative samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The negative samples are chosen using the unigram distribution. Essentially, the probability of selecting a word as a negative sample is related to its frequency, with more frequenct words being more likely to be selected as negative samples. Instead of using the raw frequency for $w_i$, $\\text{freq}(w_i)$, in the original word2vec paper, each word is given a weight that's equal to it's frequency (word count) raised to the 3/4 power. The probability for selecting a word is just it's weight divided by the sum of weights for all words.\n",

    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "P(w_i) = \\frac{ {\\text{freq}(w_i)}^{3/4} }{\\sum_{j=0}^{n} \\left({\\text{freq}(w_j)}^{3/4} \\right) }\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "This decision to raise the frequency to the 3/4 power appears to be empirical; as the author claims it outperformed other functions (e.g. just using unigram distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "Side note: The way this selection is implemented in the original word2vec C code is interesting. They have a large array with 100M elements (which they refer to as the unigram table). They fill this table with the index of each word in the vocabulary multiple times, and the number of times a word’s index appears in the table is given by $P(w_i) \\times \\text{table_size}$. Then, to actually select a negative sample, we just generate a random integer between 0 and 100M, and use the word at that index in the table. Since the higher probability words occur more times in the table, we're more likely to pick those."

    "## Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec and the concept of word embeddings originated in the domain of NLP, however the idea of words in the context of a sentence or a surrounding word window can be generalized to other problem domain dealing with sequences or sets of related data points. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A direct application of Word2Vec to a classical engineering task was recently presented by Spotify. They abstracted the ideas behind Word2Vec to apply them not simply to words in sentences but to any object in any sequence, in this case to songs in a playlist. Songs are treated as words and other songs in a playlist as their surrounding context, depending on whether the playlists in question were genre specific the vocabulary encompassed a number of songs from that collection. Now in order to recommend songs to a user one merely has to examine a neighborhood of the 'song embeddings' of songs the user already likes\n",
    "- Similarly, we could recommend a user who to connect to in a social network setting by examining the graph of relationships, where the nodes represent words and a path through the graph represents a sentence, then nodes that occur in the context of similar other nodes, would be close together in the vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples show that the general applicability of Word2Vec based algorithms is very rich and that it behooves practitioners to examine their problem domain with respect to sequences of objects that occur in some meaningful context.\n",
