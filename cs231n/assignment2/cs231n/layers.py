def batchnorm_forward( x, gamma, beta, bn_param ):
	"""
	Forward pass for batch normalization.
	
	During training the sample mean and (uncorrected) sample variance are
	computed from minibatch statistics and used to normalize the incoming data.
	During training we also keep an exponentially decaying running mean of the mean
	and variance of each feature, and these averages are used to normalize data
	at test-time.

	At each timestep we update the running averages for mean and variance using
	an exponential decay based on the momentum parameter:

	running_mean = momentum * running_mean + (1 - momentum) * sample_mean
	running_var = momentum * running_var + (1 - momentum) * sample_var

	Note that the batch normalization paper suggests a different test-time
	behavior: they compute sample mean and variance for each feature using a
	large number of training images rather than using a running average. For
	this implementation we have chosen to use running averages instead since
	they do not require an additional estimation step; the torch7 implementation
	of batch normalization also uses running averages.

	Input:
	- x: Data of shape (N, D)
	- gamma: Scale parameter of shape (D,)
	- beta: Shift paremeter of shape (D,)
	- bn_param: Dictionary with the following keys:
		- mode: 'train' or 'test'; required
		- eps: Constant for numeric stability
		- momentum: Constant for running mean / variance.
		- running_mean: Array of shape (D,) giving running mean of features
		- running_var Array of shape (D,) giving running variance of features
